## Research Questions
1. What processes should be in place to ethically create and consume technology?
2. How can we use existing lo-fi tech to understand the environment around us?
3. How can nature-based algorithms reveal aspects of nature?
4. How can connect and re-connect with space?
5. How can technology and nature have a symbiotic relationship?

- The study of how animals move through observation, recordings or computer programs.


**Anthropocene**
<br>A geological era where humans are the driving force for the structural changes on Earth.

**Biomimicry**
<br>Studying nature to solve complex human problems. Classic example are the hooks on bur fruits inspiring the invention of Velcro.

**Lunar Effect**
<br>The moon’s phases throughout the 29.5-day cycle influencing human and non-humans.

**Philosophy of Technology**
<br>A sub-domain of philosophy examining the nature of technology and the impact on culture and society.

**Situated Practice**
<br>A design practice that’s contextual based in understanding the features and characteristics of the location and the inhabitants, whether human or non-human.

### Researchers Model How Octopus Arms Make Decisions

**Dominic Sivitilli & David Gire, University of Washington**

**2019**

Scientists created a program to track octopus arm movements to infer that each tentacle are making decisions independently but can also be controlled by their nervous system when they are synchronized in movement.

### Space Sonifications

**NASA**

**2021–2024**

To experience space imagery in a different way, NASA has sonified their photos. Data is transmitted back to NASA and this data doesn’t have to be in the form of imagery, but it can be used for sound. This process is caled data sonfication, by taking data points and mapping them to sound parameters.
